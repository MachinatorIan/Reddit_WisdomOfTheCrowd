e8k4dd	Note: I'm from New Zealand, we call our holiday homes a "bach".

My husband and I own a bach in a lovely part of the country next to the beach. We inherited it from my husband's father 5 years ago after he passed away, and over that time spruced it up enough and got it to the stage where we could rent it out during the year to guests, and earn a small income from that. We live quite far away from it so engaged a company that manage/maintain the property before and after guests stay, part of the money from paying guests goes towards that fee.

Before my cousin's wedding (who we are not particulatly close to - maybe see her once a year at family events) I had been trying to think of a gift for her and her husband. I was having trouble coming up with anything so we decided that we would gift them 4 nights free accommodation in our bach this Summer. If they were fully paying guests that would be approx $700. It's an amazing location in summer, and I really wanted them to be able to enjoy it and relax after their wedding. I told her she just needed to give me a heads up 2-3 weeks in advance when they had chosen some dates to stay.

A week after the wedding she messaged me, thanking us for the use of our bach, and that she'd picked some dates in early February 2020. The dates she had chosen exceeded the 4 nights we offered.. by 10 days. She wanted to stay there with her husband for 2 weeks during the busiest, most profitable time of the year for us. I told her that I could look in to arranging that, but that she would need to pay for the extra 10 days as there are expenses that come along with having guests there (water, electricity, rates etc). Her reply was basically "Oh, I didn't think we would need to pay since it was a gift from you". I explained that we were thrilled to be able to offer 4 nights free as their wedding gift, but that we still have expenses and are not in a position financially to have people there for free for that long. I didn't get any reply from her until the following week, where she sent me an absolute novel stating how selfish and entitled my husband and I are just because we own a bach and live in the city, that they were going to make that 2 weeks their honeymoon which they now can't have. I even offered to discount the remaining 10 days by 40%, which would take over $700 off the price. Nope - I'm still selfish.

To clarify; I am a nurse working in the public health system, and my husband is in middle management for a small company. We are by NO means rich, the extra income we earn from the bach helps pay down our debt and will eventually help us buy our own home.

Her accusation that my husband and I are selfish for not letting them stay there for free for an extra 10 days and ruining their honeymoon plans has baffled me. She's even told a few family member's, some of which I believe are siding with her.

AITA?
e8k3hs	We were having a good conversation. We really were. But then we started bringing up an old topic. I hate my IUD. It hurts me when we have sex, even though it’s placed properly. I makes me FEEL pregnant. I’d honestly just rather have a baby, and tie my tubes after. But I do want one more. He said “not yet”.

I asked if he’d rather condoms, which impede a certain fetish of ours, and he just kind of huffed, but agreed. I asked if he saw himself having a baby with me in 5 or so years. Confidently, he said no. I took a moment to process the immediate pain... and then I hung up. I haven’t answered his texts. I need more time to cope. Am I being an asshole for not answering him?
e8k2ae	Here is the backstory. My parents divorced when I was 8 and I've always had a strained relationship with my father. He was always angry and rude. He treated my mother horribly and never liked the things that I did/said/me in general. Just emotionally exhausting. He liked my  little brother, but I would shelter him away on visits so my brother wouldn't be emotionally used by him as well. 

He remarried when I was 11 and moved to the other side of the state. At that point our relationship was non existant, but he was angry at my mother so he fought for visitation rights without paying child support. We had to visit him one weekend a month. 

On those weekends, I was shoved into a room with my step-sister while my brother had his own room. We were not allowed to decorate or have much stuff of our own, no dressers or closets or anything, just our suitcases. 

That one weekend a month they chose for it to be chore weekend since "we lived there so we needed to contribute" but I know they didn't do this the other weekends. Personally, I think my dad only did fun stuff with us to impress his wife. 

My dad and I always argued and I didn't want a relationship with him at all and neither did my brother once my dad started disliking him as well. I was not a model child for him. I picked arguments with him and went out of my way to be a jerk since he was being a jerk to me (this was my way of dealing with daddy issues). 

 My step-sister got pregnant when I was 15 and one month before she had the child, he stopped showing up to pick us up (this was also the weekend before my birthday). Didn't call or anything, so neither did we (this was after checking FB to see he was still alive and well). 

He and his wife, step-daughter, and step-grandchild moved to Tennessee without telling us. My step-sister is mentally unable to take care of a child, so my dad got another shot at raising a child of his own that he could raise his way (my mom took care of my brother and I 95% of the time when they were still married). 

I am now 21. Haven't seen or talked to my father since I was 15. I look on Facebook on my 21st birthday to see a message from my father saying he loves and misses my brother and I and that he'd love to talk to us again. He even sent a happy birthday gif sticker with a nickname he used when I was a young child. 

AITA for not responding? My brother blocked him and I refuse to respond back (he can't see that I've read it).
e8k1rv	I recently sold my house in a busy area of town, where outside noises always bothered me.  I bought a house in a much less busy area of town, thinking it would be a lot quieter.  Surprise, it’s not.  While it is not as loud, I still get very bothered by loud ass trucks passing my house, along with other various traffic sounds.  Any time I hear a truck I curse out (in my head) whoever is driving it.  Am I being an asshole and expecting too much?
e8k0ju	TLDR at the bottom.

My mother wasn't a very attentive one. She's mentally ill, and I suffered a lot of beatings (Asian) and psychological trauma as a kid because she would always guilt-trip me and tell people how poorly I treat her, to get others onboard.

My mom and dad divorced about 18 years ago, after my dad sent us to Canada because he was under a lot of debt from being screwed over by his business partners, and triad members were waiting outside my door a couple times.

My mum and I then moved to my aunt's, where she moved out very shortly after, because my cousin's spotted how I was physically beat (belt knuckle side of the belt). They, being much bigger and stronger than her, took me in and locked me in a room with them until my aunt and her husband came back to confront her. She made a scene, stormed off... and left me to be cared for by my aunt.

That was pretty much the end of our mother son relationship.

Fast forward till 3 days ago. She called asking me to sponsor her to Canada using a parent sponsorship. Hearing what she did to my dad when she moved back, I am extremely cautious and frankly don't really want to, as I, who is living with my gf now, have no plans to sponsor ANYONE. She told me she has the money to live off herself, she just wants the residency. However, from what I read, it's that I am LEGALLY responsible for her for up to 5 years, for all her finances. So I told her I will have to check with a lawyer about our scenario first because I am not prepared to finance her living here. Incase she comes back and sues me for neglecting her.

She tries to guilt trip me, and tells me how can I treat her like that.

The call disconnects and I am not calling back.

AITA? For not really not wanting to go through with it?

TLDR: mum after 18 years apart calls to ask for a sponsorship to Canada. Legally I would be responsible so I want to make sure I can get away from it before deciding, but in my head I don't really want to. She gets extremely upset.
e8k04j	So recently I just finished working at an orchard. For 7-8 hours I had to put huge pumpkins in a cart and haul them off to peoples cars and help put them in, if they gave us a tip, we were supposed to say no, so I did. The orchard also has fun activities like a corn maze, painting pumpkins etc, for familys who come down. There was also a bunch of food stands where on our lunch break we could go to one of the stands and buy something. But on to the part where I'm questioning if Im an asshole. So this kid asked when his break was (our breaks changed daily), then said something like "Crap, I don't have money". No I am a person who feels bad for everyone and anyone. Someone could shit in my soup and then get a scratch and I'd feel horrible for them. But he said he doesn't have money, so me being me gave him all my lunch money ($10). I didn't eat lunch and I came home with a migraine from not eating enough or whatever. My parents asked if I ate lunch and I told them no and said this one kid didn't have money so I gave him my money. They were super pisseoff at me and I felt like shit for doing what I thought was nice. So I'm questioning if I'm the asshole for giving the kid my lunch money?
e8jzvp	My friend (15F) likes to post quirky pictures of her friends on her private Instagram account. I follow this account along with about 30 other people, so it's a pretty small audience. She is a nice person at heart but sometimes can have an appreciation for dark humor (think "unplugging my grandpa's life support to charge my phone" kind of jokes).

Today she posted a Snapchat of her friend doing a dramatic evil face. Around it, she had drawn upside down crucifixes, pentagrams.. and swastikas.

It seemed like she had just tried to think of a way to be funny by drawing as many "evil" things as she could think of. But this post hit me very seriously because I'm Jewish. My grandmother had to flee her home at the age of three, hiding on a boat as Nazi planes bombed from above. She's lucky to have survived the Holocaust, and millions did not.

Seeing someone casually draw anti-Semitic hate symbols to be funny really makes me reconsider my friendship with her. She is making light of one of the worst genocides in history, one that impacted my family.

However, I know that she doesn't mean it seriously at all. Politically, she identifies as liberal Democratic. She just sees it as edgy humor. And we're partners for a project due for finals, so I can't really start a conflict now.

Would I be overreacting if I ended our friendship? Am I wrong to not say anything, as a Jewish girl? What should I do?e8jx2e	So I (M23) have been working at a growth equity company for the last year and a half. We basically invest in public stocks and mid stage private companies. Now while discussing politics is usually off limits in most jobs, but politics really affects the investment business, especially when investing in public equities.

So cut to me working at this fund. For the most part, things have been pretty good. I've been doing well and have gotten to learn a lot more about this business and have even placed some pretty large trades. So far, I've really liked working here. The people are very helpful and I've learned a ton. However, recently I joined the board of a fund that invests in clean tech and social impact focused companies. It's something I'm really proud to support as it has great people working for it and their mission is something I really align with. The founder of the fund, lets call him G, has been a mentor for me and has been really supportive of my career goals so far. However, the problem starts with me asking for some advice over the fund which I'm on the BOD for.

I take him out to lunch to discus their strategy and his thoughts on some of their current investments. I tell him basically their thesis is to accelerate sustainable innovation and improve social inequality. I tell him about a few of their clean tech investments, and he suddenly stops me. He basically goes on a rant telling me "The climate crisis was something made by the government to slow down business" and so forth. I was really shocked because we had been working together for more than a year and seemed like a very open minded person. I countered by stating some statistics that described the environmental problem we're facing. He got really upset and basically said he thought this fund was bullshit and he wouldn't help.

I was a little shocked, and after the lunch, told a few coworkers what happened. They basically called it and said he has some really strange views, and went on to say his family would protest against planned parenthood offices and were extremely against gay marriage and very pro Trump. While, I generally don't have a problem with someone supporting Trump, his reasoning seemed pretty misinformed. At this point, I felt ashamed for where I worked. I put in my 2 weeks notice and am looking for other opportunities.

My gf things I'm the AH because politics and work should be separate and my only problems with working there are political. I don't think I'm the AH since the firm's political  view are directly tied to our business and I don't want to contribute to a company with such disgusting views.
