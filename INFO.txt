e8sp25	 So I'm 24 M just finished my undergraduate degree and started working my first professional job. I saved up enough money to move out(stay out). He's always pitied and look down on me because I am not aggressive and loud and outspoken as him. I dont really like sports.  I'm an introvert and he never really understands that. It took me 6 years to finish my degree and I remember clearly when he was talking shit about me taking a little longer and that I was a failure ans what not.  Anytime when me/siblings/mom would argue with him and ask him to not do something such as returning food to the fridge after taking it out his response is "this is my house and I can do what I want." He bought me my first car when I was 20 and I crashed when I was 22( my fault) but he never lets me forget that he bought me it and kinda rubs it in my face. I do all the yardwork and stuff and heavy lifting of the house. I basically do all the chores he used to which I'm fine with. But between me(24), my sister(23), my brother(21) and mom we have told him multiple times about certain actions he does that we dont like but he doesnt care what we have to say. We have told him this over 7+ years.  During college I never enjoyed going home to visit I just did so out of obligation. I try to include on my decisions but he always shits on am idea that is not his.  No one enjoys spending time with him anymore.Tbh the family is mentally done with him.   I was my happiest when I was living on campus.  I love my father I just cant be around or spend any time with him. I might give him a weeks notice.
e8pwcy	I live at my uncles, and his sons that were kicked out for stealing from him and bringing drugs into his house come over every now and then and sleep in the living room, right next to the kitchen. I don't really care to be quiet because its the kitchen and in my opinion, if your sleeping right next to the kitchen, then you should be expecting to hear kitchen noises. Am I the asshole for having a good daily schedule?
e8o9qv	So, basically my sister (F31) has subtle bullies me (M29) and put me down and generally had an elitist attitude towards me all my life, and I believe this has had a rather significant contribution to me being the depressed anxious and self deprecating individual I am today. Well, last year, she got married, blamed me and my parents for ruining her wedding, and citing loads of other shit I was not even sure how to react to. Well, shes has recently reconnected with my parents and my mother is really trying to get everyone back together and everything... but I've told my sister that I dont want to reconnect because I want to distance myself from the toxic environment to try and better myself... I still have a good relationship with my parents and I have no intention of breaking contact with them, I thought I'd make that clear. AITA?
e8n1jb	I feel silly even posting this but my daughter told me I should after the incident.   My husband and I have 2 children - Ella (who’s 19) and William (who’s 28). They are both adults and William works full time while Ella works part-time and is in university. She’s also a vegetarian while none of the rest of us are. Sometimes she makes a meal for the whole family (often really) but during the time of final exams, she focuses on studying and she usually makes a bunch of meals in advance and freezes them to take out each night so she doesn’t have to cook beyond maybe some simple lunches or baking if she chooses. I’m proud of her for being such a healthy eater and having such good habits! Even though she eats a different meal, most nights she eats alongside us just having her vegetarian dish. I do the rest of the cooking in the family for my husband, son and myself.   She’s been studying for exams really hard lately and emerged from her room around 6:45 (hadn’t seen her since just past 1). She said she was really tired and if we didn’t mind she was going to heat up her dinner and take it to her room to watch half a movie before doing a bit more studying. She does this occasionally  when she’s had a hard day. My husband and I said sure go ahead.   When we sat down to dinner, my son asked where Ella was and I explained that she was eating in her room and why. He said “Oh can I take my stuff to my room? I want to watch Netflix too.” I hesitated but said I guess. He just huffed and said “fine I won’t. You let Ella do whatever she wants though.” Which isn’t true at all. My children are both adults and I respect this, or at least try.   AITA here? I feel (and Ella agrees with me) it’s different when she’s made her own dinner and wants a break from studying all day to relax on her own. In my sons case, I made him dinner and I guess it’s my old fashioned thinking but I feel it’s a bit rude to not sit down with a person to enjoy the dinner they’ve made for you. AITA for this thinking?
e8m5v1	Okay so let me explain super quick. My grandmother passed away. My family is Muslim. The way we do funerals is kinda extra so here it is. There's was a gathering the day she died (Thursday) at the mosque. There was a gathering the day after she died (Friday) for her funeral. There were gatherings at my house the next couple days (Saturday and Sunday) for people to come over an give us their condolences. There was another gathering at the mosque a week after she died (Thursday) and finally the last gathering the 40th day after she died. My friends knew how close I was to her. The summer previous a friend's uncle died and all his stuff was in Canada (we live in Detroit so it's not a crazy drive into Canada for us) and we went to one of the gatherings for her uncle whom according to her she wasn't that close to. My friends and i all live in the same area(ish) the mosque and my house are in super close locations and only 2 of my friends (my bff and my high school ex) came to multiple gatherings but No one else came to anything else.  Now that my grief is settling down I've gotten really mad at them (the ones that didn't show) and don't really want to hang out with any of them anymore and have been ignoring them cause I feel like a fool to have thought they were my friends. One is getting married soon and I've already been invited to the wedding over the summer but I'm so mad I don't find myself wanting to go at all.  Am I overreacting and being an asshole?? I really can't tell.   (That wasn't as brief as I meant it to be sorry)
e8klqq	In my family we have an understanding that as long as we are in school our parents will take care of us. They have explicitly stated it multiple times since my older sister was in grade 12. The plan for all of us was to graduate go to university, and while we are in school they will house and feed us.   (For context My dad is a provincial lawyer and teaches law at the local university, so that’s two good paying jobs. My mom has been a stay at home mom on and off my whole life. When she does work it’s part time just for fun and extra spending money. )  I’m 20 now and I know that I am incredibly lucky to have parents who can do this, and want to do this for us. And I am so grateful. But Things are not quite going to plan. My mental health has been getting worse and worse, to the point now that I can’t stay in school and I can’t work. I can’t take care of myself.   My parents say they want to help and support me, but they’re actions don’t always reflect that. A large part of the problem is financial. We can’t afford to get me all the help I need, we can’t afford to even get me properly diagnosed for potential disabilities my psychologist thinks I might have. The only diagnoses I have at the moment are for depression and general anxiety from when I was 13 and a new diagnoses for adhd.  I understand that we can’t afford to get more testing done, but we can afford groceries. My parents do the grocery shopping with a app as the grocery list, and they tell me to add food to that list. But then they don’t buy the food I ask for, or they don’t buy it in the quantity I need for two weeks worth of food.   This food issue has been a point of conflict for months, to the point in which I’ve gotten in multiple arguments with my sisters over it. They don’t have the same problem, because my older sister has a job, and my younger sister gets whatever food she asks for. Recently I mentioned my frustration after I ran out of food again, and my sister started arguing with me and called me selfish. I started wondering if my whole family felt that way.   Anyways I just want to know if in this situation, my parents not buying me food leading to me eating one meal a day, am I being unreasonable? I don’t want to push the issue, but I don’t have many options here. I can’t make money on my own, I can’t even start the process of applying for disability without the help of my family.   We aren’t doing bad financially and we aren’t doing awesome. But it stresses my parents out to talk about this stuff. Would I be an asshole if I brought it up with them? I know it would lead to an argument, but I think I have to start that argument and I think I’m going to do it. Does that make me an asshole?
e8khb4	I (23m) am to spend this Christmas with my GF (22F). It would be all fine and dandy if not for my mother's attitude. Soon as she learnt about it, she started guilt tripping me, saying it's our last Christmas (as I'm finishing my education next year and will be moving out), and that there might not be another time, as something might happen to her or my father (they're pushing 55, and my father has to drive 1000km to get home, though he did so often recently, we saw each other often as a consequence).   I did spend last Christmas with my GF (except for Christmas Eve), and it was fine. This one would be my second Xmas away from home. Now I want to spend the whole thing, preparations and whatnot, with my GF; it's also very important for her that I do. As a side note, my mom and my GF are in conflict, which raises the question whether it is a matter of jealousy on my mother's side.  I'm torn because, on one hand, I don't want to disappoint my parents, but on the other, I don't want to disappoint my GF (we've been through rough times recently). I don't know what to think. Or, at least, what can I do to somehow soften the blow to my parents (I've resolved to go but I've got mixed feelings still)?
e8fko7	My boyfriend has a baby on the way and she has made every attempt possible to come between us including making up lies and telling our mutual friends. She made it known that she wants him back and will text as late as 10 at night over things that have nothing to do with the pregnancy or baby. Sometimes it's about a baby item she wants and other times she is asking for his opinion on something. Several weeks ago she sent a mutual friend a text claiming he was cheating but never gave any proof. She's done everything she can to come between us and I broke down and told him he needed to draw boundaries with her and tell her not to text past 8pm unless it was really important or was an emergency. He said I was acting crazy and he couldn't do that because she will hold the baby over his head and not let him see his son. She has said some horrible things to him and one day she says she won't allow him to be involved and the next she says she'll allow it. I told him to draw boundaries with her and tell her if she keeps him from his child he'll see her in court. AITA?
e8e8h1	I couldn’t go the the funeral because my taxi driver got in a car accident and I decided to watch Family Guy while I waited for my Uber to bring me. I ended up missing his wake because of how long it took. My parents and the rest of my family were extremely pissed. Am I the asshole for doing this?
e8dtde	So my mom was married to my dad for 15 years , 5 years since the divorce she is getting married again i told her before she even decided to get married that i will not attend i dont mind who it is as long as she is happy but i dont think i can handle it psychologically i think it will break me she told me she had no one else and she needs my support and i told her i support her im happy as long as she is but i cant attend AITA  ? ( fyi im 21)
e8ctfl	Ok look, I am supposed to be the person who works and provides, but in this matter; it's all down hill for me.  Like, I can't work back to an office environment because if sickness struck my kids I have to leave work and tend for the kids. Now, this did not happen once or twice this happened a lot of times.  I kept being blamed on because (as she explained it) I'm of no use. She is homebase and works off of selling things(no, not illegal things) on social media. The reason why I wont go back to working in an office environment even though I have all the necessary experience, is because of the fear of not getting regularized in a company. Because of the un-excused absences or how most of the companies here in my country term it as failure to pass employement standards.   Let me put this on point, I have all the legal/medical papers from the hospital - heck I even have the medical certificate to prove that my kids have visited the hospital.  Since the "standard" requires only 5% absenteeism rate in the full 6 months of contractualization period, then and only then you go on to work full time in said company.  But noooo; for me I have 3 kids and all 3 of them still young, and you can't blame them getting sick since kids are kids. Also let me make this clear we don't have anyone to leave our kids to when one of them gets sick it is always me who goes to the emergency room with the sick child. It hurts my attrition because 5% is too low.    Now moving on, since I left the office environment I went ahead and proceeded to work as a public transport service using a motorcycle [explanation here]( https://angkas.com/blog/posts/what-is-angkas-and-how-do-i-use-it) where I gain $20-$30 a day or 8-10 hours of public transport. Compared it to $6-$9 of office work. With this kind of work I be my own boss no one to bug me around telling me I was late or absent. I work on my own term.  But she disagreed because it does not "help". I honestly don't understand what she meant and want. So I help out around the house practically everything from taking the kids to school, cooking lunch and dinner, picking up kids, washing the clothes, cleaning the house. Damn I do every house chore in a week, sometimes I slack off because I am honestly frustrated.  Her family thinks of me as a lazy couch bastard who just sleeps all day wakes up to eat and goes back to sleep. They are ****ing blind I tell you. They assume that I don't do anything around the house.  So tell me AITA?
e89tnr	Tl;dr: Finalising my journey of coming out *will* cause tension over the holidays, in the worst case scenario it could taint my grandfather's (potential) last Christmas alive.  I've (22F) have been coming out as a bisexual woman over the past 3 years or so. I'm explicitly out to essentially everyone except for my extended family. I've wanted to come out to them for 2 years, but knowing their lack of knowledge will cause me strain/ there will be arguments and inappropriate questions, I haven't had the courage to do it.  Staying closeted has been easy logistically: I only see them over Christmas, it's fairly easy for me to stay in the closet for 2 weeks of the year (although I **have** nearly outed myself a few times by messing up pronouns, I think they're already suspicious of my "I'm just a passionate ally!" ruse); but hard emotionally, I can get sad because I feel like the people I love most in the world don't fully know me, I'm not my authentic self around them.  **HOWEVER** two things changed in the past year:  * My grandfather's health has worsened tremendously, and this year may be the last chance I get to talk to him honestly about this.    * On one hand this motivates me to tell him, it feels selfish but if it goes well I think it would be a great memory to have.    * On the other hand I don't want our last few days together to be tainted if it goes badly. * I learned that a younger member of my extended family (13F) is likely also queer. I see myself as a role model to her, and I want to come out just to lower the hurdles for her to come out later, should she choose to do so. I remember my early teens being a really confusing, shameful time for me, and I'd like to limit that for her, even if it's just within the family.  As I said, the only real opportunity is over the holiday season, and I know it will cause some drama. I know that when the dust settles, they'll still love me, but there are a handful (2-4) of older family members who are the sort of people that say "I'm fine with gay people, but I don't want it pushed in my face", when I've ever mentioned bisexuality in passing the response is "that it isn't real", "I think it's just young people being confused", "they do it for attention" etc.  I'm torn here: WIBTA if I come out, knowing it will cause tension and could ruin my grandfather's potential last Christmas?  EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: because of his illnesses, my grandmother will not leave his side for more than a few minutes; he is one of the older family members that may react badly to the news. My other fear is that my family is extremely close and will start to talk to each other after I come out to one of them, as they really don't understand privacy very well. I will have to come out in pretty quick succession so that it doesn't come as a shock to someone I haven't yet told.
e87srf	The parfume was still packed in its original box. My mum is the only woman in the house. One day, after the GF of my brother was at our place again, my mum realised that her parfume got unboxed and is missing. The empty box was on the ground. ////// My mum asked her if she took it and she raged and started crying. She left the house immidently. My mum apoligized and everyrhing is cool now again. But the question is: Was it wrong to say it was her?
e87a7q	So before a family funeral I got shitfaced and got on the phone with my fwb. She had just gotten out of the hospital for an overdose like 2 weeks before, concidentally the same day my relative died.  We talked for a little while, like an hour or so. We both vented about things. I was pretty messed up and drunk honestly if I was her I'd just have said "call me when you're sober".  She lives in another city so I texted and asked her when she'd be in town (to...you know...have benefits) because it had been a while since she'd been in town.   And then BAM ghosted it's been two months. I guess I was out of line but I was drunk. We've been friends for two years and we always talked about everything so I'd obviously apologize if she didn't completely shut me out.
e8747x	I've been known to be quite pushy to a fault. Last week, I have a real problem getting my passive, comfortable and less qualified superior to get involved in a project he assigned the team. I initiated the work a month prior before taking a 2 weeks break, came back on Monday and nothing was being done. I further add on the work on the day itself and has been pushing him to review my work. He keeps telling me he's busy and will be reviewing tomorrow, everyday till Friday.  On Friday night, I went from hoping he would participate to just wanted for his opinion and feedback to just proceeding ahead without him with his OK, as its understood that I'm more familiar with this area. He said again to get back to me and didn't. Sunday night, I reminded him again we have limited time, things been put off since a month ago and I felt disrespected that I was given empty promises.  He gave me some half ass response that could've been given days ago and further pressed that he was busy that I'm not looking at the big picture. Dude the thing has been sitting around for a month and you had nothing of value to add, and its possible of his disinterest or lack of confidence of proceeding with such things that I couldn't even get a dignified response till I pressed on. I further pressed the issue and said it's not okay, which winded up into a long conversation about him suggesting I'm not right for the team, my resignation, his personal problem that I had no way of knowing, excuses that he had big plans for me that's why he haven't gotten back to me. Also, for the week that I'm back I wasn't assigned a single job (we are both quite senior), he wasn't even attempting to lead.  I had another face to face with him today and it seems like he's adamant about 'not having time', nor willing to compromise. I was hired to do what he is unable, and I don't think he's interested or is really intimidated by my role. It might need to escalate to management if nothing is being done as I can't perform.  What can I do, AITA?
e86uci	My partner is a pescatarian (vegetarian who eats fish/seafood) and at home I don’t eat meat but will when I go out, also I do not ever eat pork - note that this is simply an aversion to it and not cultural/religious.  My group of friends regularly go round to each other’s houses for dinners (the ones of us who own our homes with no flatmates) and have a great time - basically when we go to each other’s house we have a main meat dish which is not pork and the host usually gets something for my SO like a vegetarian ‘meat’ patty to cook up, or a fish fillet. Then all the sides/vegetables so it works pretty well.  However, one of my friends (I’ll call him Jeff) always moans that ‘we’ can’t have pork because my SO and I are there. It is incredibly rude and he does it loudly in front of us. My other friends have told him to pull his head in before. He honestly makes such a big deal about it to the point that my SO and I have politely declined the invite a few times so he can ‘have’ pork.  The other thing - when it’s at his house, he never gets my SO the ‘meat’ patty or fish fillet which everyone else gets for her when it’s at their homes - this is because he ‘hates fish and fake meat’. I have to text him before we get to his to ask whether we should pick her something to eat up and he always says that there’s plenty of vegetables, however he OFTEN puts goose fat in the roasted vegetables so she can’t eat 1/2 the vegetable sides anyway. My SO is super polite and doesn’t like if I complain on her behalf so will just be pretty hungry if it’s at his, but I have spoken to him several times in private and said it’s really frustrating for us when he doesn’t cater for her and doesn’t warn us ahead of time so we can bring our own food. He also insists on having the dinners at his house a lot of the time because he likes to drink a few glasses of wine and doesn’t like having to either taxi or not drink.   I know he’s TA for all this, however this is where we run into issues - when we host we usually will make two or three main dishes; one fish, one vegetarian dish, and I will also often cook a meat dish and then the vegetables/sides as well. We always have a load of food and always get lots of compliments (I’m a pretty good cook). If I’m not making a meat dish for everyone I will cook a few beef/lamb sausages or similar for Jeff because he doesn’t like to eat fish and will always complain about the vegetarian main. This is the issue though, Jeff has started asking if he can bring bacon to our house for him to cook and eat on the side. He says it’s the same as having the fake ‘meat’ patty or the fish brought to his house since he hates fake meat and fish but I really see it differently since I still provide him with (non-pork) sausages or other meat.  Am I TA for telling him no, when I still want my SO to bring her options to his house?
e85ss1	My fiancé’s cousin is dating this guy Ty, who I worked for over a decade ago. Ty and I had sex before, during and after work.  I slept with the majority of Ty’s employees that year, as well as his best friend, all of which he found out.  It didn’t end well.   I’m normally completely comfortable with my fiancé’s family, no awkwardness, no fear; until Ty came into the picture. Family functions aren’t the same now. Each time I’m uncomfortable and on-edge because Ty is there.  I’ve made two solid attempts at making amends and smoothing things over with Ty, both times he’s hasn’t replied. He seems like the “all-fun-no-real-feelings” type, which I don’t know how to connect with.   My fiancé is adamant that he’s inviting this cousin and Ty to our wedding, and thinks I’m being petty for wanting to not include them in the reception.  Am I the asshole?
e82yjm	I’ve been casual friends with M for about a year now. I met him incidentally through college. I do admit that I do not know him deeply because we occasionally hang out (every 3-6 weeks) and when we do hang out all he does is complain especially complain about his dad so there’s not really space to deepen the friendship.   As he’s still in college, he lives off his dad (mom passed away years ago) and is financially dependent on him. He complains about his dad complaining about him, he complains about his dad telling him to be conscious of his spending on their shared credit card that his dad pays for, he complains about his dad not buying groceries, he complains about his dad always relying on him to drop his little sister off to volleyball, etc. Every 2-3 hours we hang out, he always finds something to complain about usually his dad as the main subject or some other friend.   It’s soooo exhausting listening to him complain every time we hang out. I subtly suggested that he should move out considering that his dad seems to be the root of of all his troubles, but he went silent when I suggested it. I’ve been debating to tell him to go to therapy so he can work his complaining out, but I don’t want to make it weird. As a friend, I want him to feel safe to emotionally open up to me yet at the same time I don’t want to be an emotional crutch and his sounding board to complain about all the things that make him unhappy, but does nothing to fix it.
e82y0j	So my girlfriend and I have been going out for a few weeks now, and things have been going well. Yesterday we had sex in the morning and after I finished we saw the condom had broke (not like a hole or anything, completely busted and hanging down below the "ring" at the base, also neither of us noticed because she was on top leaning towards me). I only include the graphic details because I want to establish that I'm very certain she's not trying to trick me or anything, which is the crux of this post. She's very sweet and career-oriented, additionally I've known her for about a year, and in that time I've seen her cry because she was accidentally mean to someone. For this, and so many other reasons I have zero reason to believe she would ever try to secretly get pregnant or anything crazy.  Now for the main point: After realizing the situation, we went out to buy Plan B and then went to our separate apartments before she took it. Because I trust her, it never crossed my mind to watch her take it or anything, but when I brought it up to a buddy of mine (yeah yeah I don't like to kiss and tell but it was freaking me out) he asked if I watched her take it and was astounded when I said I didn't. Now he has me second-guessing if I should have. Would I be an asshole for calling her and asking for confirmation (just verbal reassurance I guess, since it would have already happened) that she actually took it? I don't want her to think that I don't trust her but my same friend also said he thought it would be a dick move to ask after-the-fact. Another thing is that I won't see her for a few days since we're busy so I can't bring it up in person, it would need to be an explicit call/text.
e8200s	My friend calls me up yesterday and asks me if I’m expecting a UPS package from X company. Why yes. She says she’s looking at it on the loading dock of her office building.   Apparently, several times recently when the truck is too full, the guy unloads half the shipment at the first stop (her building), leaves it on her indoor loading dock, delivers half the truck, and then goes back later to get the rest off the dock and deliver it.   My friend happened to see my name on top. With my permission she brought my package home just to see if someone could walk away with stuff. Yup. As far as the driver knows, it got stolen. (I did not report it stolen, but I didn’t report it delivered either.)   She and I are now deciding whether and how to report this guy. I don’t want to get the guy fired before Christmas, but I also don’t want my packages stolen off a random loading dock. Think it’s lesson enough to make him “lose” one package? AITA for “taking delivery” off the record? WIBTA for reporting him? Will UPS fire him or just tell him to knock it off?  Edit: The package tracking says it was delayed “due to weather or natural disaster” and should arrive Dec 7-Dec 12.  My friend offered to talk to the delivery guy tomorrow and tell him we won’t report him if he doesn’t do it again. Based on these comments, I’m leaning toward reporting it though.  Edit 2: My friend is waiting to hear back from someone at her company on whether the guy has permission to drop off the packages there. It’s a small town, so it’s entirely possible the guy’s buddy said it was cool to just leave it on the dock. If that’s the case, we’ll tell him to cut it out since obviously no one is watching the packages. If he doesn’t have permission, we will report him.  Thank you all for the comments and feedback.
e7yvwt	So back story I’m the oldest child currently getting a liberal arts degree and trying to start fashion.   My parents are both old but are in their mind still. They have 4 life insurance policy’s that will grant a total sum of 1.4 million to their heirs.   Recently they changed it to where I receive 25 percent instead of 33. Which is fine but I wasn’t present when my other two siblings were there. I’m in New York and they live in Missouri.  I’m the only one willing to take them in instead of a nursing home and I called out my other two siblings.   Basically explained how they resented our parents for little to no reason. They since changed all of our shares back to an equal 33%.   My parents said I did the right thing but my siblings said that I was Ta.   So begin my judgement Reddit
e7xw5o	Few weeks ago a new neighbors moved into my building.   Since they moved in I haven't seen then much around here. I saw an older man (grandpa) with a little boy. He said his daughter is moving in.   Well, from the moment they moved in I have noticed a kid crying. Probably not every day but like every other or third day.  But there can be more that I have missed. Really histerical at some point.   I don't want to over react but I'm curious if the kid is alright. Are there some things I should check or find out before actually callin? Really don't want to mess up regular family by being too proactive.e7wlm7	Me and this girl started flirting for about 5 weeks, and went on a date. She tells me that “we are a thing. Just not to my parents.” Then the day after that she gets in a relationship with someone else. I’m told that she get in to a relationship the day after that by not her but one of our mutual friends. Then after telling her that I would prefer her not taking to me after she lead me on. She had her friend spam me telling me to for give her leading me to block her and the friend.  Am I in the wrong for being mad? Sorry formatting is bad first post, and sorry for spelling mistakes.
