e8k472	So, this story is happening over 4 years. 

Me and my best friend were hanging out when we met G, a handsome, nice guy. I told my bff on the spot that he's the one for me. I really liked him.

Because of a lot of issues such as us being young and life getting in the way we never got to be together even if he did have feelings for me too. We sometimes talked about them but never made a move to be more than friends.

My best friend knew most of the story. I was mostly keeping it low key but I kept on telling her how much I wish to be with him. 

Those things lasted for almost 4 years. We were in different relationships but they never lasted because we were in love with each other and we were waiting for the right moment. After those 4 years my bff start dating G. When they told me I was heartbroken but I didn't want to make any drama as he wasn't my boyfriend or anything. They broke up after 2 months but they stayed friends. 

Now, 6 months after they broke up, G and I were both single and he told me he loves me, he had only dated her to get my attention and he thinks is the moment to try a relationships together. I said yes because I really wanted it for a long time. My best friend stoped talking to me and told everyone that I was shitty and that I stole her boyfriend. 

So, AITA for being with the guy that I loved for a long time?
